Computer Graphics - Project 1
 
This program uses the most recent version of three.js (87), which has a different method of importing fonts than the
method given to us through lecture notes. The function fontLoader causes errors when trying to run index.html on Chrome,
the 3D text does not appear at all ("xmlhttprequest cannot load cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes" error). 
To alleviate this problem, you must run a local server to run the program in Chrome or just use a different web browser
(Firefox or Microsoft Edge work).
